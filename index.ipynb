    "2. An `LSTM()` layer (or `GRU()` layer, for the second model) of size `50`. During this step, also set the `return_sequences` parameter to `True`, so that during back propagation our models will calculate loss and learn for every step of the sequence, not just the final result of the sequence.\n",
    "3. A `GlobalMaxPool1D()` layer, so that our model performs a combined _MaxPool_  operation across all weights in the recurrent layer. \n",

    "5. A `Dense()` layer of size `50`, with this layer's `activation` parameter set to `'relu'`\n",
    "6. Another `Dropout()` layer set to `0.5`\n",
    "7. A `Dense()` layer that will act as our output layer. This layer should contain `20` neurons (one for each possible predicted class), and should have it's `activation` parameter set to `'softmax'`\n",

    "There we have it! In this particular case, GRUs strongly outperformed LSTMs in the first epoch, but the gap quickly leveled out between them by the end of epoch 2. When comparing LSTMs and GRUs for a given task, this isn't always the case--there are certainly times where LSTMs will outperform GRUs. However, overall, GRUs seem to have a slight advantage over LSTMs. The interesting thing about this is that researchers don't yet know _why_ GRUs tend to slightly outperform LSTMs, especially when GRU cells are a bit simpler than LSTM cells. This is an ongoing area of cutting-edge research in the field of Deep Learning--maybe someday, you'll be the one to solve this mystery!\n",
